TODOs:
- add more tests
- check runtime consistency with null/undefined
- fix bad error messages: "name must be a `string` type, but the final value was: `null`.\n If \"null\" is intended as an empty value be sure to mark the schema as `.nullable()`"
- number | string
- `any` type in the swagger docs is broken
